# Algorithm

In computing, an algorithm is a set of computational instructions that solve a problem or achieve a particular outcome.
The computational instructions are instructions that could be implemented in a typical programming language (typically involving input, output, sequence, selection, iteration and storage), although general algorithms are usually expressed in pseudo-code rather than in a programming language.
