# Terminal

In a grammar, a terminal is a symbol that is in the final string that the grammar is producing.
Generally a terminal is written in lower case letters, and non-terminals are written in capital letters.
For example, in the production S -> aaBbb, the "a" and "b" are terminals, and the "S" and "B" are non-terminals.

In a programming language, the terminal could be a keyword, such as "if", "else" or "def".
