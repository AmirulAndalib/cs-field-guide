# Plane Turbulence Interactive

**Original Author:** Jackie Qiu

This interactive is created to introduce the Fitts' Law section.
The user is the pilot of a plane, and is tasked with completing a series of actions.
As the game progresses, the weather and turbulence worsens.
This interactive will get the user thinking about how the environment can affect the usability of a user interface.
This is a 'fun' interactive, meant to complement the other more technical interactives of the section.
