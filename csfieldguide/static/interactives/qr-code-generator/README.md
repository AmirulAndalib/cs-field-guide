# QR Code Generator Interactive

**Author:** Jack Morgan

This interactive is created for generating and modifying QR Codes.

URL parameters can be added to configure how the interactive is loaded:

- `text=X` can preset the text of the QR code where `X` is a string.
- `level=X` can preset the level of error correction the QR code uses, where `X` is one of the following: `L`, `M`, `Q`, or `H`.
- `hide-controls` can be used to hide the options for the user to change the text and error correction.
