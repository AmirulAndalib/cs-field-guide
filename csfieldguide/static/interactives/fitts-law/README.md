# Fitts' Law Experiment Interactive

**Original Author:** Jackie Qiu

This interactive is created to allow users to conduct their own Fitts' Law Experiment.
This will help to explain Fitts' Law, including how the width of a target and the distance to it affects movement time. 
The diagrams (located in static/img/chapters/source-files/fitts-diagrams.drawio) were created using 
https://www.diagrams.net/. They can be modified by creating a new diagram in diagrams.net and importing the 
fitts-diagrams.drawio file.
